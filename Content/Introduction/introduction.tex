In the last 10? years, Scrum has become vastly used in the Software industry. 
Studies \footnote{https://www.versionone.com/pdf/state-of-agile-development-survey-ninth.pdf, page 9}
 suggests that about 72\% of agile frameworks used are Scrum or Scrum variations.
 
Given that Scrum is the most commonly used framework in the industry, we believe it would prove too difficult to convince the industry to change framework, discarding Scrum.
Therefore we have looked at frameworks which support and complement Scrum.

In recent years, an interest for Lean Software Development (LSD) has become apparent, hence a study about the compatibility of these two frameworks is relevant. \Alexander{Source?}


\section{Scrum Overview}
%http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/704720/Scrum-explained
Scrum consists largely of three roles, %ScrumMaster, Product Owner, and Team.
five practices, %sprints, planning meetings, daily meetings, review meetings, and retrospective meetings.
and three artefacts. %Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Burn Down Chart.
The purpose of the roles, practices, and artefacts are to support the principles of Scrum which are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Something
\end{itemize}

\section{Lean Software Development Overview}
Lean Software Development consists of the seven principles:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Eliminate waste.
	\item Amplify learning.
	\item Decide as late as possible.
	\item Deliver as fast as possible.
	\item Empower the team.
	\item Build integrity in.
	\item See the whole.
\end{itemize}


\section{Compatibility}
When aggregating these two frameworks, just from looking at the principles of each framework, it is clear that some principles oppose or complement each other. 
Some of the principles which oppose each other are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item ...
	\item Approach to team management/leadership
	\item ...
\end{itemize} 

This study will focus on the conflicts in the team leader role, what impact it has on the team, and how to facilitate the aggregation between the two frameworks.
