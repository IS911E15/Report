Scrum is currently the most used agile framework. According to the \textit{9th Annual State of Agile™ Survey} \citep{VersionOne}, 56\% of the companies that do agile development use Scrum and at least 16\% more use Scrum combined with something else.

The overall principles of Scrum were first introduced by \citet{Takeuchi1986}, formalised a few years later by \citet{Schwaber} and it has since been refined into what it is today.
They describe Scrum as a lightweight framework for managing complex product development. 

Scrum has become a success because it allows for flexibility as well as predictability.
It is especially good for creating an overview of the upcoming tasks and structure the work process.

Although Scrum has several good aspects, some can prove to be counter productive in certain practical contexts.
One such context can be, as often reported, that planning takes much longer than compared to its usefulness.
Another, often reported, context is that the retrospective meetings seldom is fruitful and often does not contribute to solve or improve the process, but instead handles trivial issues like “The vending machine is often out of cokes”.
Other cases where the practical context does not comply with the framework can be:
Sprint length does not fit well. E.g. A very important user story has been completed in the start of the sprint, but it will not be accessible to the customer until after the sprint end;
Distributed teams, where it is not possible to sit in the same physical space as the rest of the team.

(
Besides these practical issues with Scrum, there are also fundamental issues in the framework.
The framework encourages self-organising teams, due to the fact that no man can be knowledgeable about all areas in the development process. But when Scrum-of-Scrums meet, a single member from each team are expected to be just that.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Er der altid både ScrumMaster og Project Manager?
	\item Er det muligt at splitte Team Leader rollens opgaver mellem SC og PM. E.g. Process Improvement til SM og tracking til PM.
\end{itemize}







Problems:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Distributed teams.
	\item Using good procedures, but not good practices. E.g. no unit test as standard.
	\item Lack of support tools, e.g. automated tests, one-click deployment.
	\item Too much focus on maintaining velocity.
	\item Scheduling time for exploratory projects.
	\item Handling of unexpected fire fighting e.g. “We didn't set aside 2 days for fixing an issue, but had to do it anyway, now our sprint is running behind, what do we do?”
	\item Understand and Estimation of/in story points.
	\item Bad Product owners. No authority, not reachable, etc.
	\item Impossible to answer client about final release date.
	\item Where do the UX design fit into an iteration?
	\item “Amount of perceived rework as substantially higher since many "architectural concerns" are not discussed immediately because they are not necessary for "the minimum thing that works." It takes experienced designers to keep the amount of rework and speculative features balance under control.”
	\item Wrong use of stand-up meetings. e.g. Product owner runs meeting; management status instead of actual help to team.
	\item Agile/Scrum is isolated to the development team but the rest of the organization continues to function "the old way".
	\item Financial forecasting and budgeting ahead for a full year make being "adaptable" challenging.
	\item Team members not allocated full-time.
	\item When a Project Manager migrates to a Scrum Master role, making the leap from command and control to a facilitating/enabling role.
	\item MINDSET
	\item Legacy code. How can we cope with it (maintain/rewrite/test cover) and how do we make sure new teams do feel responsible for it as well?
	\item Architecture. How do we deal with emergent vs. upfront architecture in Scrum? How do we apply changes to the architecture (consult and involve architect vs. everybody by themselves)? Is there an architect role allowed at all and if so, how to involve him/her?
	\item Defects. How to integrate in the PB or defect backlog? How to plan them? How to deal with an overwhelming count of defects (QA sprints vs. on the fly)
	\item  A scrummaster acting as a teamleader (command - control).
	\item Personalities within a scrum team are not balanced well.
	\item Stand up meetings take too long.
	\item Retrospectives are getting boring
	\item 
\end{itemize}
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The idea of self-organising teams was introduced in XXX due to the problems with the previous approach of XXX.
... many occurrences of self-organising teams turning to self-organising chaos are reported ...
... this problem is, according to XXX, often due to either failed implementation, misunderstood values, or poor/lack of leadership. ...

The aspect of process improvement on the team level are in Scrum managed by the retrospective meetings. These meeting, however, are reported by XXX, XXX, and XXX to often be poorly conducted, unfruitful, and a waste of time. 

... looked at frameworks which values process improvement on the team level ...
... Lean ... Lean may be an option for solving some of the shortcomings of Scrum. ...
