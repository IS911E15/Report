In the last 10 years, Scrum has become vastly used in the Software industry.
In recent years, an interest for Lean has become apparent, hence a study about the compatibility of these two frameworks is prudent.

When looking at aggregating these two frameworks, multiple conflicts arise.
Some of the areas where conflicts arise is:
\begin{itemize}
	\item ...
	\item Team Leader role
	\item ...
\end{itemize} 

This study will focus on the conflicts in the team leader role, what impact it has on the team, and how to facilitate the aggregation between the two frameworks.






Two different currents in agile (lean vs scrum)

Product:
-Method? Maybe with incorporated conflicts 
-Pure literature study?
